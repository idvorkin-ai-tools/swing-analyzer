## What Didn't Go Well

### Friction Patterns (from Claude logs)

**Direction Corrections (25+ instances):**

- "No, make the PR against origin/main"
- "No look at the code in origin/main"
- "NO https://github.com/.../commits should only have that fix not the other crap"

**Themes:**

1. **PR Scope Issues** - PRs including unrelated changes
2. **Rebase Confusion** - "Why do we keep messing that up?"
3. **Branch Target Mistakes** - PRs against wrong branches
4. **Debugging Loops** - "Are you stuck?" / "try again"

### Technical Issues

- Rep gallery scroll behavior took multiple iterations
- Zoom feature required several CSS transform fixes
- E2E test selectors breaking on UI changes

---

## Action Items

### Process Improvements

1. [ ] **PR Scope Discipline** - Add pre-PR checklist: "Does this PR contain ONLY the requested changes?"
2. [ ] **Rebase Workflow** - Document common rebase scenarios and fixes
3. [ ] **E2E Selector Stability** - Prefer data-testid over dynamic IDs

### Documentation Updates

1. [ ] Add retro workflow to CLAUDE.md
2. [ ] Add usage review commands to CLAUDE.md
3. [ ] Document PR scope guidelines more explicitly

### Technical Debt

1. [ ] swing-7 inactive (0 commits) - consider cleaning up
2. [ ] swing-3 on stale branch - merge or rebase
3. [ ] Multiple swing-analyzer-\* clones may be stale

---

## Metrics to Track Next Retro

- Correction count ("No..." messages)
- Rework cycles (commits with "fix:" after initial implementation)
- Time from task start to PR merge
- Test coverage for new features

## Workflow Recommendations (Merged)

_From session 2025-12-05:_

| Pattern                                                | Recommendation                                            | Status    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Agent created worktrees, user corrected to full clones | Use full clones for multi-agent setups, not worktrees     | ✅ merged |
| Confusion about which remote to push to                | Document: `origin` = ai-tools fork, `upstream` = idvorkin | ✅ merged |
| Agent reviewed chop-conventions without pulling latest | Always fetch/pull before reviewing external repos         | ✅ merged |
| Agent missed commit ID in "Last reviewed" date         | PR #7 sent to chop-conventions                            | ✅ merged |
